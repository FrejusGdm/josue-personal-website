When I started learning Chinese, I realized something important: **textbooks lie**.

Well, they don't *lie*, but they tell a very specific, sanitized version of the truth. They teach you how to ask for directions to the library, but not how to joke with a taxi driver or negotiate a price at the market.

## The Input Hypothesis

Stephen Krashen's *Input Hypothesis* suggests that we learn best when we understand messages that are just slightly above our current level (i + 1). But traditionally, we've tried to force output before input.

> "We acquire language in one way and only one way: when we understand messages."

## Building Echo

This is why I'm building **Echo**. I wanted a tool that didn't just quiz me on vocabulary, but actually spoke to me. A tool that could simulate:

- Ordering coffee in Beijing
- Negotiating a business deal
- Asking for help in a rural village

We need technology that mimics the chaos and beauty of real conversation, not just the order of a classroom.
