The next billion users coming online won't be using a desktop computer. They won't even be using an iPhone. They'll be using low-cost Android devices, often with intermittent connectivity.

## The Constraints

When we build for this demographic (which includes many users in Benin and across Africa), we have to rethink our assumptions:

1.  **Data is expensive**: Every megabyte counts.
2.  **Latency is high**: Round-trips to a server in Virginia don't cut it.
3.  **Literacy varies**: Voice interfaces are often more intuitive than text.

## Offline-First is not Optional

For **Climaflake**, we aren't just "adding offline support" as a feature. It is the *core* architecture.

```javascript
// A mental model for offline-first sync
if (!navigator.onLine) {
  saveToLocalDatabase(data);
  queueSyncForLater();
}
```

We are exploring local-first LLMs that can run on-device, ensuring that a student in a remote village has the same access to personalized tutoring as a student in a connected city.
