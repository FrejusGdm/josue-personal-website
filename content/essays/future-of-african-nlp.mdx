The world of Natural Language Processing is moving at breakneck speed. Yet, for billions of people, this revolution is happening in a language they do not speak.

## The Gap

While English, Chinese, and Spanish see massive improvements in AI capabilities, thousands of "low-resource" languages are being left behind. This isn't just a technical problem; it's a cultural one.

> "Language is not just a tool for communication; it is a vehicle for culture."

## What We Can Do

Building for these languages requires a different approach. We cannot simply rely on massive web-scraped datasets because they don't exist. Instead, we need:

1. **Community-driven data collection**: Working directly with native speakers.
2. **Efficient architectures**: Models that learn from less data.
3. **Multimodal learning**: Using speech and text together to bridge gaps.

This is what drives my work with **Echo** and my research into Adja.
