Based on what I know about you, here's how I'd define you:

**Who you are:**
You're a multilingual technologist and researcher bridging cultures and breaking down language barriers through AI. As a senior at Dartmouth studying Computer Science with a Chinese minor, you're pioneering NLP work for Adja—an under-resourced West African language from Benin—while co-founding Echo, a speech-focused AI language learning app.

**What drives you:**
You're passionate about democratizing education through technology, especially for underserved communities in Africa. Your work isn't just about technical achievement—it's about meaningful impact. Whether you're collecting datasets from native Adja speakers in Benin's Kouffo region or building tools to help people learn languages more effectively, you're focused on solving real problems for real people.

**Your unique perspective:**
You ranked first among 80,000 students on your national high school diploma in Benin, then transitioned to English-language education in the US. Now you speak four languages and you're studying in Beijing, giving you a rare vantage point across African, American, and Chinese contexts. This positions you uniquely to build technology that actually works across cultural and linguistic boundaries.

**Where you're headed:**
You're preparing for PhD programs (Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon on your radar) with a clear vision: using AI to transform education in ways that work for everyone, not just the well-resourced. Your Schwarzman Scholars application and ongoing research show you're committed to building bridges—between languages, cultures, and opportunities.

Would you like me to adjust the tone or emphasis for your website?

 So on the project page, how do we want to display the projects? I guess 'echo' should maybe redirect to
  an echo page where I explain why I'm building 'echo', and so on and so forth for some pictures of
  myself, the issues that I face, and so on and so forth, but don't spend too much time doing xyf.

  The second thing is that what I'm interested in is project A. So for project A, when I click on it, I
  want to see 'Climaflake.' I would like to have a page like sesame.com https://www.sesame.com/,

  2025-10-29 at 12.49.02 PM.png' explaining my vision around education and AI in africa. here is what we
  are building for project A "We are building an AI tutor designed for Africa, with three defining
  features:
      1.    Always available: runs on small, efficient LLMs deployed on the edge, so students can learn
  offline without constant internet access.
      2.    Truly local: supports native African languages and aligns with national curricula (e.g.,
  Beninese, Nigerian exam standards), so the learning experience is culturally and academically relevant.
      3.    Adaptive and expansive: beyond curriculum support, the tutor can personalize learning to each
  student curiosity, helping them explore topics they are curious about (e.g., Pythagoras’ theorem) with
  clear explanations, interactive guidance, and step-by-step learning paths.(1) - that can run on device
  (common cell phone, tablet, etc)
  (2) models trained from ground up on African languages and fine tuned on theIexams
  (3) and also add cultural awareness. Like there are many subtle cultural differences in communication
  that just dont work in Africa and it needs to integrate well to the culture. (e.g. how we refer to
  people of different ages is different in Ethiopia)
  "\
  \
  to reach that point, we will have to solve a lot of problems (i want something like the sesame page)But
  the idea is that to be able to do that, we have to solve multiple problems:

  - Being able to run small models on the edge using the devices that are available at home

  - Being able to get good enough translators or LLM in those native languages

  - Adding a physical infrastructure to this

  Because in Africa, education can rarely be solved by just an app. We need a real physical, I'm thinking
  about the heart, it's going to be like some kind of modulable learning centers.

  Anyway, it's a huge vision and I would just like to lay down there and see what's up. I don't know.
