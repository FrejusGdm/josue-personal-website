Based on what I know about you, here's how I'd define you:

**Who you are:**
You're a multilingual technologist and researcher bridging cultures and breaking down language barriers through AI. As a senior at Dartmouth studying Computer Science with a Chinese minor, you're pioneering NLP work for Adja—an under-resourced West African language from Benin—while co-founding Echo, a speech-focused AI language learning app.

**What drives you:**
You're passionate about democratizing education through technology, especially for underserved communities in Africa. Your work isn't just about technical achievement—it's about meaningful impact. Whether you're collecting datasets from native Adja speakers in Benin's Kouffo region or building tools to help people learn languages more effectively, you're focused on solving real problems for real people.

**Your unique perspective:**
You ranked first among 80,000 students on your national high school diploma in Benin, then transitioned to English-language education in the US. Now you speak four languages and you're studying in Beijing, giving you a rare vantage point across African, American, and Chinese contexts. This positions you uniquely to build technology that actually works across cultural and linguistic boundaries.

**Where you're headed:**
You're preparing for PhD programs (Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon on your radar) with a clear vision: using AI to transform education in ways that work for everyone, not just the well-resourced. Your Schwarzman Scholars application and ongoing research show you're committed to building bridges—between languages, cultures, and opportunities.
