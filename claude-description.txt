Okay, let's go ahead and make just a tiny few changes. Somewhere, I think in the deep bio, I said that I'm from a country. Let's remove "tiny," let's just keep it a country. I don't want to put the name of my country negative or anything, so I would like to change that. Now the Echo project page, let's reformat it just like the Davis piece project or calendar AI: better structure, less space between the paragraphs, not like it is right now. You should go and check the Kind AI and Davis B's project. We want to make it feel like a blog, like Medium or some stuff like that, we are writing, that's the vibe we are going for.

So for Echo, it's an interesting project because I'm going to tell you more. Don't use M-dashes by the way, just tell the story. 

I was learning Chinese. I already speak French, English, and a bit of the language Aja, which is spoken in my home country. At Dartmouth, it was a requirement to learn a new language. I could have run over that requirement, but I decided because I already knew French, I could basically skip that requirement. But I decided not to and I decided to learn a new language, Chinese, that I've never learned before. That was the first time I was learning Chinese.

It was really, really hard. I took classes for about a year, learned the grammar, the vocabulary, I was able to write and read and so on and so forth. But one thing really bothered me, the fact that I could not really speak in Chinese. We did have drills where we practiced speaking, but it wasn't enough for me to actually gather a mastery of the language.

At that point, I've been already deep in the AI world and I realized that voice AI tools were good enough to give you a close to real-time conversation with AI tools. So I built Echo, which is just a speech-focused language learning app that gives you a tutor that corrects you when you make mistakes and so on and so forth.

Initially, I built a web app, then I scripted and over the summer, I think I started in March, then I scripted the website and I built an app because even myself didn't see myself learning a language on a web app. Then I did the mobile app. After the mobile app, I got a hundred users to try it and give me feedback. It was great, great things. I've learned so much about it.

I've talked about, for example, Vapi and I've been using Vapi for a lot of the orchestration and battling with Vapi's documentation and everything that they had that was wrong. Their documentation back then wasn't that good and I think that even still today it's still not the best.

I used Vapi and that allowed me to dive a lot into a lot of different voice providers: Cartesia, Eleven Labs. Shout out to Cartesia, I think they have one of the best voices out there, especially for multilingual stuff. I've learned a lot, built a full stack app in Expo, learned a lot about Expo, cross-platform development, back-end, front-end, and just security. It was just an amazing experience.

Currently, everything was live. We even had a mobile app up there on the App Store. Everything was live with everything, but now I shut down the app and I want to rebuild it from scratch using better knowledge that I have right now from all of the time and also building a better experience for Echo.

I think design has always been my weak point and I've been working on improving my design and stuff like that and just trying to think about what I want to build. Echo is a project that is done but I'm still doing actively because I want to rebuild the app and scale it, learn more about marketing and variety. If you would love to talk about that, I would love to talk with you.
